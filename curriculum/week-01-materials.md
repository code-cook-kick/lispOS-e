# Week 1: Legal Thinking Meets Programming Logic

*Foundation Week: Understanding the Bridge Between Law and Code*

## üéØ Week Overview

This foundational week introduces legal professionals to the core concepts of programming through the lens of legal reasoning. You'll discover how your existing legal thinking skills translate directly into programming logic, making the transition from lawyer to lawyer-programmer natural and intuitive.

## üìö Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 1, you will be able to:
1. **Identify parallels** between legal reasoning and programming logic
2. **Set up and navigate** the Etherney eLISP development environment
3. **Run and analyze** existing legal applications
4. **Recognize opportunities** for automation in your legal practice
5. **Plan your learning journey** based on your legal specialization

## üóìÔ∏è Daily Schedule

### **Day 1: Legal Reasoning as Computational Logic**

#### **Morning Session (2 hours)**
- **Concept**: Legal rules as algorithms
- **Activity**: Analyze how legal syllogisms work like programming logic
- **Reading**: [`LEGAL-CODING-GUIDE.md`](../LEGAL-CODING-GUIDE.md) - Section 2 "Legal vs Programming Thinking"

#### **Practical Exercise**
Map these legal concepts to programming equivalents:
```
Legal Concept ‚Üí Programming Concept
Statute/Article ‚Üí Function
Legal Condition ‚Üí If-statement  
Legal Outcome ‚Üí Return value
Case Facts ‚Üí Input parameters
Legal Precedent ‚Üí Reusable function
```

#### **Reflection Questions**
1. How do you currently apply logical reasoning in your legal practice?
2. What legal processes do you repeat frequently that could benefit from automation?
3. Which legal calculations do you perform manually that could be coded?

### **Day 2: Introduction to the Etherney eLISP System**

#### **Morning Session (2 hours)**
- **Setup**: Install Node.js and configure the development environment
- **Exploration**: Navigate the project structure and understand the components
- **Demo**: Run the Family Estate Calculator and analyze its functionality

#### **Hands-On Activities**
1. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   # Install Node.js (v18+)
   # Clone or download the Etherney eLISP system
   # Navigate to project directory
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run Demo Applications**
   ```bash
   npm run demo-calculator
   npm run estate-calculator
   npm run legal-examples
   ```

3. **Explore Project Structure**
   ```
   project/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/evaluator.js          # Core eLISP interpreter
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ family-estate-calculator.js # Interactive calculator
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/                  # Learning examples
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/                     # Test suites
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                      # Documentation
   ```

#### **Assignment**
- Successfully run all demo applications
- Document what each application does in legal terms
- Identify which legal areas each application addresses

### **Day 3: Basic Programming Concepts for Lawyers**

#### **Morning Session (2 hours)**
- **Concept**: Variables as legal facts
- **Concept**: Functions as legal rules
- **Practice**: Reading and understanding simple legal code

#### **Code Reading Exercise**
Analyze this simple legal eligibility checker:
```lisp
(define can-vote?
  (lambda (age is-citizen?)
    (and (>= age 18) is-citizen?)))
```

**Legal Translation**:
- `can-vote?` = Legal rule for voting eligibility
- `age` and `is-citizen?` = Legal facts (input parameters)
- `(>= age 18)` = Age requirement condition
- `is-citizen?` = Citizenship requirement condition
- `and` = Both conditions must be true
- Return value = Eligible (true) or not eligible (false)

#### **Practice Questions**
1. What legal rule does this code implement?
2. What are the legal requirements being checked?
3. How would you modify this for different age requirements?
4. What additional legal conditions might you add?

### **Day 4: Identifying Legal Automation Opportunities**

#### **Morning Session (2 hours)**
- **Analysis**: Review your current legal practice
- **Identification**: Find repetitive legal processes
- **Prioritization**: Select high-impact automation opportunities

#### **Legal Practice Analysis Worksheet**

#### **Prioritization Matrix**
Rate each opportunity (1-5 scale):
- **Frequency**: How often do you do this?
- **Time Consumption**: How long does it take?
- **Error Risk**: How prone to mistakes?
- **Client Value**: How much would clients benefit?

### **Day 5: Planning Your Legal Coding Journey**

- **"This won't apply to my practice"** ‚Üí Every legal practice has automation opportunities

### **Building Confidence**
- Remember: You already think algorithmically as a lawyer
- Legal reasoning is more complex than basic programming
- Your legal expertise is the hard part; programming is just a tool
- Every expert was once a beginner

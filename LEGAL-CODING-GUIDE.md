## Introduction: Why Code Legal Rules? {#introduction}

As a lawyer, you already think systematically about rules, conditions, and outcomes. Programming is simply another way to express this logical thinking - but with the power to:

- **Automate calculations** (inheritance distributions, damages, tax computations)
- **Ensure consistency** (same rule applied uniformly across all cases)
- **Handle complexity** (multiple interacting legal provisions)
- **Verify accuracy** (test edge cases and boundary conditions)
- **Scale efficiently** (process hundreds of cases instantly)

### Real-World Impact

Instead of manually calculating inheritance for each family:
```
Manual: 2 hours per case × 50 cases = 100 hours
Coded: 5 minutes setup × 50 cases = 5 minutes total
```

## Legal Thinking vs Programming Thinking {#legal-vs-programming}

| Legal Concept | Programming Equivalent | Example |
|---------------|----------------------|---------|
| **Statute/Article** | Function | `calculate_inheritance()` |
| **Legal Condition** | If-statement | `if (spouse_exists)` |
| **Legal Outcome** | Return value | `return spouse_share` |
| **Case Facts** | Input parameters | `(estate_value, family_structure)` |
| **Legal Precedent** | Reusable function | Call same function for similar cases |
| **Legal Test** | Unit test | Verify function works for known cases |

### Example Translation

**Legal Rule (Article 996, Civil Code):**
> "If the deceased is survived by spouse and children, the spouse gets 1/4 and children get 3/4 of the estate."

**Code Translation:**
```lisp
(define article-996
  (lambda (estate-value spouse-exists? children-count)
    (if (and spouse-exists? (> children-count 0))
        (begin
          (define spouse-share (* estate-value 0.25))
          (define children-total (* estate-value 0.75))
          (define child-share (/ children-total children-count))
          (list spouse-share child-share))
        ; Handle other cases...
        )))
```

---

## Basic Concepts: Variables and Functions {#basic-concepts}

### Variables: Legal Facts as Data

In law, you work with facts. In code, these become **variables**:

```lisp
; Legal facts become variables
(define estate-value 1000000)      ; ₱1,000,000 estate
(define spouse-exists? #t)         ; Spouse is alive (true)
(define children-count 3)          ; 3 children
(define deceased-age 65)           ; Age at death
```

### Functions: Legal Rules as Procedures

Legal rules become **functions** that take facts and produce outcomes:

```lisp
; Legal rule becomes a function
(define calculate-legitime
  (lambda (estate-value children-count)
    (begin
      ; Article 888: Legitime is 1/2 of estate for children
      (define legitime-total (* estate-value 0.5))
      (define per-child (/ legitime-total children-count))
      per-child)))

; Use the function
(define child-legitime (calculate-legitime 1000000 3))
; Result: ₱166,666.67 per child
```

---

## Translating Legal Conditions {#translating-conditions}

Legal rules often have conditions. Here's how to translate them:

### Simple Conditions

**Legal:** "If the deceased has no children..."
**Code:** `(if (= children-count 0) ...)`

**Legal:** "If the spouse survives..."
**Code:** `(if spouse-exists? ...)`

### Complex Conditions

**Legal:** "If there are children but no spouse..."
```lisp
(if (and (> children-count 0) (not spouse-exists?))
    ; children-only inheritance
    ; other cases
    )
```

**Legal:** "If the estate exceeds ₱5 million or there are more than 5 heirs..."
```lisp
(if (or (> estate-value 5000000) (> total-heirs 5))
    ; special handling
    ; normal handling
    )
```

### Nested Legal Conditions

**Legal Rule:** "Inheritance depends on family structure..."

```lisp
(define determine-inheritance
  (lambda (spouse? children-count parents?)
    (if spouse?
        (if (> children-count 0)
            "Spouse + Children case"      ; Article 996
            (if parents?
                "Spouse + Parents case"   ; Article 1001
                "Spouse only case"))      ; Article 999
        (if (> children-count 0)
            "Children only case"          ; Article 979
            "No spouse, no children case"))))
```

---

## Working with Legal Calculations {#legal-calculations}

### Percentage-Based Distributions

Many legal calculations involve percentages:

```lisp
; Article 996: Spouse gets 25%, children get 75%
(define distribute-estate-996
  (lambda (estate-value children-count)
    (begin
      (define spouse-share (* estate-value 0.25))
      (define children-total (* estate-value 0.75))
      (define per-child (/ children-total children-count))
      (list spouse-share per-child))))

; Example: ₱1M estate, 2 children
; Result: (250000 375000) - spouse gets ₱250K, each child gets ₱375K
```

### Progressive Calculations

Some legal rules have tiers or brackets:

```lisp
; Example: Progressive tax calculation
(define calculate-tax
  (lambda (income)
    (if (<= income 250000)
        0                                    ; No tax for ≤₱250K
        (if (<= income 400000)
            (* (- income 250000) 0.20)       ; 20% for ₱250K-₱400K
            (+ 30000                         ; ₱30K base
               (* (- income 400000) 0.25)))))) ; 25% for >₱400K
```

### Proportional Distributions

When dividing assets proportionally:

```lisp
; Divide estate proportionally among heirs
(define proportional-distribution
  (lambda (estate-value heir-shares)
    (begin
      (define total-shares (apply + heir-shares))
      (define share-value (/ estate-value total-shares))
      (map (lambda (shares) (* shares share-value)) heir-shares))))

; Example: ₱1M estate, heirs get 2:1:1 ratio
; (proportional-distribution 1000000 (list 2 1 1))
; Result: (500000 250000 250000)
```

---

## Building Legal Decision Trees {#decision-trees}

Complex legal rules often form decision trees. Here's how to code them:

### Example: Succession Rights Decision Tree

```lisp
(define determine-succession-rights
  (lambda (deceased-info family-info)
    (begin
      (define spouse? (get family-info 'spouse-exists))
      (define children (get family-info 'children-count))
      (define parents? (get family-info 'parents-alive))
      (define siblings (get family-info 'siblings-count))
      
      ; Decision tree following Civil Code hierarchy
      (if spouse?
          ; Branch 1: Spouse exists
          (if (> children 0)
              (article-996-distribution deceased-info family-info)  ; Spouse + children
              (if parents?
                  (article-1001-distribution deceased-info family-info) ; Spouse + parents
                  (spouse-only-distribution deceased-info family-info))) ; Spouse only
          ; Branch 2: No spouse
          (if (> children 0)
              (children-only-distribution deceased-info family-info)    ; Children only
              (if parents?
                  (parents-only-distribution deceased-info family-info) ; Parents only
                  (siblings-distribution deceased-info family-info)))))))  ; Siblings/others
```

## Practical Examples {#practical-examples}

### Example 1: Simple Inheritance Calculator

Let's build a basic inheritance calculator step by step:

```lisp
; Step 1: Define helper function for key-value pairs
(define kv (lambda (key value) (list key value)))

; Step 2: Basic spouse-only inheritance
(define spouse-only-inheritance
  (lambda (estate-value)
    (list (kv 'spouse estate-value))))

; Step 3: Children-only inheritance
(define children-only-inheritance
  (lambda (estate-value children-count)
    (begin
      (define per-child (/ estate-value children-count))
      (list (kv 'per-child per-child)))))

; Step 4: Combined spouse and children (Article 996)
(define spouse-and-children-inheritance
  (lambda (estate-value children-count)
    (begin
      (define spouse-share (* estate-value 0.25))
      (define children-total (* estate-value 0.75))
      (define per-child (/ children-total children-count))
      (list (kv 'spouse spouse-share) (kv 'per-child per-child)))))

; Step 5: Main calculator function
(define calculate-inheritance
  (lambda (estate-value spouse? children-count)
    (if spouse?
        (if (> children-count 0)
            (spouse-and-children-inheritance estate-value children-count)
            (spouse-only-inheritance estate-value))
        (if (> children-count 0)
            (children-only-inheritance estate-value children-count)
            (list (kv 'other-relatives estate-value))))))
```

### Example 2: Legal Age Verification

```lisp
; Legal concept: Age of majority, legal capacity
(define check-legal-capacity
  (lambda (person-age)
    (begin
      (define is-minor? (< person-age 18))
      (define is-adult? (>= person-age 18))
      (define is-senior? (>= person-age 60))
      
      (if is-minor?
          (list (kv 'status 'minor) (kv 'capacity 'limited))
          (if is-senior?
              (list (kv 'status 'senior) (kv 'capacity 'full) (kv 'benefits 'senior-discount))
              (list (kv 'status 'adult) (kv 'capacity 'full)))))))
```

### Example 3: Contract Validity Checker

```lisp
; Legal concept: Essential elements of contracts
(define check-contract-validity
  (lambda (consent? object? cause? form-required? form-complied?)
    (begin
      (define has-consent consent?)
      (define has-object object?)
      (define has-cause cause?)
      (define form-ok (if form-required? form-complied? #t))
      
      (define all-elements (and has-consent has-object has-cause form-ok))
      
      (if all-elements
          (list (kv 'validity 'valid) (kv 'enforceable #t))
          (list (kv 'validity 'invalid) 
                (kv 'missing-elements 
                    (filter (lambda (x) (not (cdr x)))
                            (list (cons 'consent has-consent)
                                  (cons 'object has-object)
                                  (cons 'cause has-cause)
                                  (cons 'form form-ok)))))))))
```

## Advanced Patterns {#advanced-patterns}

### Pattern 1: Legal Rule Composition

Combine multiple legal rules:

```lisp
; Compose multiple legal checks
(define comprehensive-inheritance-check
  (lambda (estate-info family-info)
    (begin
      ; Step 1: Validate inputs
      (define validation (validate-estate-data estate-info family-info))
      
      ; Step 2: Calculate basic inheritance
      (define basic-calc (calculate-basic-inheritance estate-info family-info))
      
      ; Step 3: Apply special rules (legitime, donations, etc.)
      (define adjusted-calc (apply-special-rules basic-calc estate-info))
      
      ; Step 4: Generate final distribution
      (define final-dist (finalize-distribution adjusted-calc))
      
      ; Return comprehensive result
      (list (kv 'validation validation)
            (kv 'basic-calculation basic-calc)
            (kv 'adjustments adjusted-calc)
            (kv 'final-distribution final-dist)))))
```

### Pattern 2: Legal Precedent System

Build a system that learns from cases:

```lisp
; Store legal precedents
(define precedent-database (list))

; Add new precedent
(define add-precedent
  (lambda (case-facts legal-outcome reasoning)
    (begin
      (define new-precedent (list (kv 'facts case-facts)
                                  (kv 'outcome legal-outcome)
                                  (kv 'reasoning reasoning)))
      (set! precedent-database (cons new-precedent precedent-database)))))

; Find similar precedents
(define find-similar-cases
  (lambda (current-facts)
    (filter (lambda (precedent)
              (similar-facts? (get precedent 'facts) current-facts))
            precedent-database)))
```

### Pattern 3: Legal Document Generation

Generate legal documents from calculations:

```lisp
; Generate inheritance distribution document
(define generate-distribution-document
  (lambda (estate-info family-info calculation-result)
    (begin
      (define header (format-header estate-info))
      (define family-section (format-family-info family-info))
      (define calculation-section (format-calculations calculation-result))
      (define legal-basis (format-legal-citations calculation-result))
      (define signature-section (format-signature-block))
      
      (string-append header family-section calculation-section 
                     legal-basis signature-section))))
```

## Testing Your Legal Code {#testing}

### Unit Testing Legal Functions

Test individual legal rules:

```lisp
; Test Article 996 implementation
(define test-article-996
  (lambda ()
    (begin
      ; Test case 1: ₱1M estate, spouse + 2 children
      (define result1 (calculate-inheritance 1000000 #t 2))
      (define expected1 (list (kv 'spouse 250000) (kv 'per-child 375000)))
      (assert-equal result1 expected1 "Article 996 - basic case")
      
      ; Test case 2: ₱500K estate, spouse + 1 child
      (define result2 (calculate-inheritance 500000 #t 1))
      (define expected2 (list (kv 'spouse 125000) (kv 'per-child 375000)))
      (assert-equal result2 expected2 "Article 996 - single child")
      
      ; Test case 3: Edge case - very small estate
      (define result3 (calculate-inheritance 100 #t 3))
      (define expected3 (list (kv 'spouse 25) (kv 'per-child 25)))
      (assert-equal result3 expected3 "Article 996 - small estate"))))
```

### Integration Testing

Test complete legal scenarios:

```lisp
; Test complete inheritance scenario
(define test-complete-inheritance-scenario
  (lambda ()
    (begin
      ; Setup: Deceased with ₱2M estate, spouse, 3 children
      (define estate-info (list (kv 'value 2000000) (kv 'debts 200000)))
      (define family-info (list (kv 'spouse #t) (kv 'children 3) (kv 'parents #f)))
      
      ; Execute: Calculate inheritance
      (define result (comprehensive-inheritance-check estate-info family-info))
      
      ; Verify: Check all aspects
      (assert-true (get result 'validation) "Estate data should be valid")
      (assert-equal (get (get result 'final-distribution) 'net-estate) 1800000)
      (assert-equal (get (get result 'final-distribution) 'spouse-share) 450000)
      (assert-equal (get (get result 'final-distribution) 'per-child-share) 450000))))
```

### Property-Based Testing

Test legal properties that should always hold:

```lisp
; Property: Total distribution should equal net estate
(define test-distribution-totals
  (lambda (estate-value spouse? children-count)
    (begin
      (define result (calculate-inheritance estate-value spouse? children-count))
      (define total-distributed (sum-all-distributions result))
      (assert-equal total-distributed estate-value 
                    "Total distribution must equal estate value"))))

; Property: Children should get equal shares
(define test-equal-child-shares
  (lambda (estate-value children-count)
    (begin
      (define result (calculate-inheritance estate-value #f children-count))
      (define child-shares (get-all-child-shares result))
      (assert-all-equal child-shares "All children should get equal shares"))))
```

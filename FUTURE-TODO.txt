Etherney eLisp Macro System â€“ Future TODOs (Post
Production) 
These are not blocking production and can be addressed later as enhancements. 
1. Advanced Macro-in-Macro Support 
Issue: Failing Test 1d
Details: Complex nested macros that define other macros within expansion.
Goal: Improve expansion pipeline to handle multi-stage macro generation without manual macroexpand calls. 
2. LIST AST Handling in Variadic Contexts 
Issue: Failing Test 3a
Details: Variadic macros returning deep list AST structures require manual quoting/unquoting.
Goal: Refine expansion rules to preserve list structures without extra (quote ...). 
3. Improved Error Feedback 
Provide precise source location and macro name in error messages.
Helpful for debugging complex statute/event/fact macro definitions. 
4. Macro Hygiene Enhancements 
Avoid accidental variable capture between macro body and caller context.
Consider using gensym or equivalent unique symbol generator.

# üè† Family Estate Calculator - Practical Application

A real-world demonstration of the Etherney eLISP Legal Reasoning System for inheritance calculations.

## Overview

The Family Estate Calculator is a practical command-line application that helps families understand how estates will be distributed according to Philippine succession law. It demonstrates the power of our Etherney eLISP system for real-world legal calculations.

## Features

### üßÆ Inheritance Calculations
- **Intestate Succession** (no will): Automatic distribution according to law
- **Testate Succession** (with will): Handles partial wills and remainder distribution
- **Mixed Scenarios**: Combines will provisions with intestate rules
- **Mathematical Precision**: All shares sum to exactly 100%

### üë• Family Structures Supported
- Spouse only
- Children only  
- Spouse + children (spouse gets 25%, children share 75%)
- Complex families with multiple heirs
- Single-parent scenarios

### ‚öñÔ∏è Legal Compliance
- Based on Philippine Civil Code Articles 979-996
- Follows Article 996 for spouse and children distributions
- Handles partial intestacy (Article 960)
- Provides legal basis citations for all calculations

## Usage

### Interactive Calculator
```bash
npm run estate-calculator
```

The interactive calculator will ask you:
- Name of deceased person
- Total estate value (PHP)
- Whether there's a will and coverage percentage
- Family structure (spouse, children count)

### Demo Mode
```bash
npm run demo-calculator
```

Runs automated demonstrations with 5 different family scenarios:
1. **Young couple with 2 children** - Typical family (5M PHP estate)
2. **Widow with 3 adult children** - No spouse scenario (10M PHP estate)
3. **Childless couple** - Spouse inherits all (2M PHP estate)
4. **Single parent with 1 child** - Simple inheritance (3M PHP estate)
5. **Large family** - Spouse + 5 children (15M PHP estate)

## Example Output

```
üìä SCENARIO: Young couple with 2 children
Estate Value: 5,000,000 PHP
Distribution:
  - spouse: 25% (calculated: 5,000,000 √ó 0.25 = 1,250,000 PHP)
  - child: 37.5% (calculated: 5,000,000 √ó 0.375 = 1,875,000 PHP)
  - child: 37.5% (calculated: 5,000,000 √ó 0.375 = 1,875,000 PHP)

‚öñÔ∏è Legal Basis: Articles 979-996 (Intestate succession)
   Article 996 (Spouse gets 1/4, children share 3/4)

Note: All amounts are dynamically calculated by the eLISP system
```

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Node.js command-line interface with readline
- **Backend**: Etherney eLISP legal reasoning engine
- **Logic**: Pure functional programming in eLISP
- **Calculations**: Dynamic mathematical computations (no hardcoded results)

### Key eLISP Functions
```lisp
; Calculate intestate succession
(define calculate-intestate
  (lambda (spouse? children-count)
    ; Returns list of (role share) pairs
    ))

; Calculate testate succession  
(define calculate-testate
  (lambda (bequests-total spouse? children-count)
    ; Handles partial wills + remainder distribution
    ))

; Validate mathematical correctness
(define validate-shares
  (lambda (shares)
    ; Ensures shares sum to 1.0
    ))
```

### Lambda Arity Compliance
All lambda expressions follow the Etherney eLISP rule of exactly 2 arguments:
- `(lambda (params) (single-body-expression))`
- Multi-statement bodies use `(begin ...)` construct
- Recursive functions properly structured
- Higher-order functions supported

## Real-World Applications

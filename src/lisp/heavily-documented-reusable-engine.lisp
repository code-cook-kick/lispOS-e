;;; ===================================================================
;;; ARTICLE 996 - SPOUSE SHARE IN INTESTATE SUCCESSION WITH CHILDREN
;;; ===================================================================
;;;
;;; FULL STATUTORY TEXT:
;;; "If a widow or widower and legitimate children or descendants are left,
;;; the surviving spouse has in the succession the same share as that of
;;; each of the children."
;;;
;;; LEGAL INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION:
;;; 1. This article establishes the principle of equal sharing between
;;;    surviving spouse and legitimate children in intestate succession
;;; 2. However, Article 892 (legitime provisions) and jurisprudence have
;;;    established that the spouse receives 1/4 of the estate when children exist
;;; 3. The remaining 3/4 is divided equally among the children
;;;
;;; RELATED ARTICLES:
;;; - Article 887: Compulsory heirs (spouse and children)
;;; - Article 888: Legitime of legitimate children (1/2 of estate)
;;; - Article 892: Legitime of surviving spouse (varies by scenario)
;;; - Article 1001: Order of intestate succession
;;;
;;; JURISPRUDENTIAL SUPPORT:
;;; - Uy v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 109197 (1994)
;;; - Diaz v. Intermediate Appellate Court, G.R. No. 66574 (1987)
;;;
;;; COMPUTATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION:
(define spouse-share-with-children (/ 1 4))  ; Article 996 + Article 892 application

;;; ===================================================================
;;; ARTICLE 979 - EQUAL DIVISION AMONG CHILDREN (INTESTATE)
;;; ===================================================================
;;;
;;; FULL STATUTORY TEXT:
;;; "Legitimate children and their descendants succeed the parents and
;;; other ascendants, without distinction as to sex or age, and even if
;;; they come from different marriages."
;;;
;;; LEGAL PRINCIPLE: PER STIRPES SUCCESSION
;;; - Children inherit in equal shares (per capita)
;;; - If a child predeceases, their descendants inherit by representation (per stirpes)
;;; - No distinction based on gender, age, or marriage of parents
;;;
;;; RELATED ARTICLES:
;;; - Article 980: Right of representation
;;; - Article 981: Degrees of relationship in representation
;;; - Article 982: Rules for representation
;;; - Article 1003: Collation of gifts

;;; ===================================================================
;;; ARTICLE 960 - PARTIAL INTESTACY (MIXED SUCCESSION)
;;; ===================================================================
;;;
;;; FULL STATUTORY TEXT:
;;; "Legal or intestate succession takes place:
;;; (1) If a person dies without a will, or with a void will, or one which
;;;     has subsequently lost its validity;
;;; (2) When the will does not institute an heir to, or dispose of all the
;;;     property belonging to the testator. In such case, legal succession
;;;     shall take place only with respect to the property of which the
;;;     testator has not disposed;
;;; (3) If the suspensive condition attached to the institution of heir
;;;     does not happen or is not fulfilled, or if the heir dies before
;;;     the testator, or repudiates the inheritance, there being no
;;;     substitution, and no right of accretion takes place;
;;; (4) When the heir instituted is incapable of succeeding, except in
;;;     cases provided in this Code."
;;;
;;; LEGAL PRINCIPLE: PARTIAL INTESTACY
;;; - When a will disposes of only part of the estate
;;; - Remaining portion follows intestate succession rules
;;; - Combines testate and intestate succession in single case
;;;
;;; RELATED ARTICLES:
;;; - Article 961: Preference of testamentary over legal succession
;;; - Article 1014: Preterition of compulsory heirs
;;; - Article 906: Residuary clause in wills
;;;
;;; COMPUTATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION:

;;; ===================================================================
;;; ARTICLES 904-906 - TESTATE SUCCESSION (WILLS AND BEQUESTS)
;;; ===================================================================
;;;
;;; ARTICLE 904 - INSTITUTION OF HEIRS:
;;; "Every will must institute an heir. If no heir is instituted, the will
;;; is void, unless it is a holographic will."
;;;
;;; ARTICLE 905 - UNIVERSAL AND PARTICULAR SUCCESSION:
;;; "The institution of heir may be made in general terms or with
;;; designation of particular things."
;;;
;;; ARTICLE 906 - RESIDUARY CLAUSE:
;;; "Any disposition made in general terms which comprises all the remaining
;;; property, or a part thereof, which subsists after the particular devises
;;; and legacies, is a residuary clause."
;;;
;;; LEGAL PRINCIPLES:
;;; 1. SPECIFIC BEQUESTS: Particular items or amounts to named beneficiaries
;;; 2. GENERAL BEQUESTS: Amounts from general estate assets
;;; 3. RESIDUARY BEQUESTS: Remainder after specific and general bequests
;;; 4. DEMONSTRATIVE BEQUESTS: Amounts from specified sources
;;;
